# File-Renamer
## File Renaming Tool

The File Renaming Tool is a Python script that allows you to rename a set of files in a directory and sequentially move them to a different location. It provides a convenient way to rename files with a desired name followed by numbers in a user-specified format.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Modify the `source_directory` and `destination_directory` variables to specify the appropriate source and destination directories.
3. Run the script.
4. Follow the prompts to input the desired file name and starting number for renaming.
5. The files in the source directory will be renamed sequentially and moved to the destination directory.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* The shutil module (included in the Python standard library)

`Remember to replace the placeholder links, such as `/path/to/source/directory` and `/path/to/destination/directory`, with the appropriate paths in your actual README file.`
